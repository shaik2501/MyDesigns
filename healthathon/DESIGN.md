# Health-a-thon — Design Blueprint and Reusable Build Prompt

> Use this document as the visual authority for future healthcare, research, social-impact, or institutional innovation websites inspired by the Health-a-thon design language. Preserve its hierarchy, color roles, spacing, card geometry, image treatment, and responsive behavior while replacing the source branding, copy, and protected assets with original project material.

## 1. Reference and audit scope

- Source audited: <https://healthathon.reskilll.com/>
- Live title: `Health-a-thon 2026 · India's First Doctor × Technology Health Hackathon`
- Audit date: 2 September 2026
- Desktop measurement viewport: `1280 × 720 CSS px`, DPR `2`
- Desktop document: approximately `1265 × 3945 CSS px`
- Mobile measurement viewport: `390 × 844 CSS px`
- Mobile document: approximately `375 × 7411 CSS px`, excluding the scrollbar
- Visual reference: [`healtha-ton.png`](healtha-ton.png)

This is a design-system study, not permission to copy partner logos, photography, trademarks, event copy, or medical claims. Use original or licensed assets in new projects.

## 2. Design concept

Create an institutional healthcare-innovation landing page that feels credible enough for doctors and research organizations, approachable enough for students and builders, and modern enough for an AI hackathon.

The visual formula is:

```text
clinical clarity + institutional trust + technology optimism
```

The page avoids stereotypical neon “AI” styling. It uses:

- White and pale blue-gray backgrounds.
- Deep navy typography and controls.
- A restrained green-to-blue title gradient.
- Real clinical collaboration photography.
- Strong partner-logo visibility.
- Rounded white information cards with quiet shadows.
- Compact, evidence-oriented copy rather than oversized decorative sections.

## 3. Design personality

The interface should feel:

- Trustworthy and calm.
- Modern but not experimental.
- Inclusive across clinical and technical audiences.
- Information-dense without appearing crowded.
- Institutional, organized, and measurable.
- Human-centered rather than machine-centered.

Avoid:

- Dark cyberpunk backgrounds.
- Fluorescent gradients.
- Glassmorphism.
- Cartoon medical imagery.
- Red as a general brand color.
- Heavy drop shadows.
- Excessive animation.
- Generic stock-photo grids.

## 4. Color system

### 4.1 Core tokens

```css
:root {
  /* Structural */
  --health-ink: #0a1628;
  --health-primary: #0c3c6c;
  --health-muted: #4d5d70;
  --health-secondary-text: #2a3a4c;

  /* Surfaces */
  --health-white: #ffffff;
  --health-mist: #f3f6f9;
  --health-ice: #e8f0f7;
  --health-border: rgb(10 22 40 / 0.10);
  --health-border-strong: rgb(10 22 40 / 0.22);
  --health-pale-blue: #9ec0dc;

  /* Brand/title gradient */
  --health-green: #0b7a3e;
  --health-teal: #0f6f6a;
  --health-indigo: #1a3d9c;
  --health-year-blue: #152a8a;

  /* Domain accents */
  --health-cancer: #1a5f9e;
  --health-diabetes: #a15c00;
  --health-maternal: #b83280;

  /* Rewards */
  --health-prize: #f5a623;
}
```

### 4.2 Color hierarchy

| Role | Color | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| Primary structural | `#0A1628` | Main headings, footer, dark feature panels, critical copy |
| Primary action | `#0C3C6C` | Filled CTAs, major display title, icons, links |
| Secondary copy | `#4D5D70` | Paragraphs, partner descriptions, supporting labels |
| Alternating surface | `#F3F6F9` | Partner, eligibility, and prize sections |
| Pale utility surface | `#E8F0F7` | Chips, inset controls, technology partner strip |
| Border | `rgba(10,22,40,.10)` | Card edges and section rules |
| Prize accent | `#F5A623` | Prize amount, trophy details, reward emphasis |

### 4.3 Title gradient

Use the green-to-blue gradient only for the event/product name or one comparable identity mark.

```css
.brand-gradient-text {
  background: linear-gradient(
    92deg,
    #0b7a3e 0%,
    #0b7a3e 38%,
    #0f6f6a 52%,
    #1a3d9c 66%,
    #1a3d9c 100%
  );
  background-clip: text;
  color: transparent;
}
```

Do not use this gradient on buttons, large surfaces, every heading, or decorative backgrounds.

### 4.4 Domain accents

- Cancer: blue `#1A5F9E`.
- Diabetes: warm brown-orange `#A15C00`.
- Maternal and child health: magenta `#B83280`.
- Use the accents only on domain names, tiny icons, or category chips.
- Always include text labels; color is not the only identifier.

### 4.5 Surface rhythm

Alternate white and mist surfaces to separate dense informational modules without large empty gaps:

```text
white hero → mist partners → white use cases → pale design-scope panel
→ mist eligibility → white team structure → mist rewards → dark navy footer
```

## 5. Typography

### 5.1 Font stacks

```css
--font-display: "Sora", "Inter", system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
--font-sans: "Inter", system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
--font-mono: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, monospace;
```

- `Sora` creates the rounded, modern institutional heading voice.
- `Inter` carries navigation, body copy, CTAs, labels, and metadata.
- Use monospace only for technical data if needed; it is not a major visual element in the audited page.

### 5.2 Weight system

- `800`: hero display, section H2s, card H3s, major numerical value.
- `700`: subtitle, CTA labels, compact overlines, important inline phrases.
- `600`: navigation, category names, emphasized body phrases.
- `400`: body text and descriptions.

### 5.3 Desktop type scale

| Element | Size | Line height | Weight | Tracking |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Gradient event name | `46.4px` | `45.472px` | `800` | `-1.624px` |
| Year | `29.6px` | `29.6px` | `800` | `-0.74px` |
| Hero audience title | `58.4px` | `63.072px` | `800` | `-0.48px` |
| Hero action line | `32px` | `34.56px` | `800` | `-0.48px` |
| Hero subtitle | `19.2px` | `20.736px` | `700` | `-0.48px` |
| Centered section H2 | `37.6px` | `43.616px` | `800` | `-1.128px` |
| Compact section H2 | `29.6px` | `40.7px` | `800` | `-0.888px` |
| Eligibility H2 | `25.6px` | `26.88px` | `800` | `-0.768px` |
| Use-case H3 | `20px` | `28px` | `800` | `-0.6px` |
| Partner H3 | `15px` | `20.625px` | `800` | `-0.45px` |
| Body | `16px` | `24px` | `400` | normal |
| Small body | `13–14px` | `19.5–21px` | `400` | normal |
| Overline | `11px` | `11.55–16.5px` | `700` | `1.1px` |
| Nav/footer label | `11–13px` | `16.5–19.5px` | `600–700` | normal |

### 5.4 Mobile type behavior

- Gradient event name: `31.2px / 30.576px` at `390px` viewport.
- Hero audience title should scale to roughly `34–38px` with a compact two-line wrap.
- Section headings scale to approximately `28–32px`.
- Body remains `15–16px`; do not shrink the information to fit.
- Preserve bold hierarchy and negative tracking, but reduce line lengths before reducing font size.

### 5.5 Editorial rules

- Use title case or uppercase selectively; not every heading is uppercase.
- Major centered section headings may use sentence/title case.
- Functional sections such as “WHO CAN APPLY” and “TEAM STRUCTURE” use uppercase.
- Keep paragraphs calm and neutral; emphasis is achieved through bold inline phrases and color-coded domain names.
- Center only key section titles. Long descriptions and card copy remain left-aligned.

## 6. Layout system

### 6.1 Container

- Main maximum container: `1220px`.
- At the `1265px` desktop document width, content begins around `51px` from the left.
- Major two-column content ends around `1215px`.
- Mobile content width: approximately `335px` inside `20px` left/right margins at a `375px` document width.
- Use `max-width: 680px` for centered heading blocks.
- Long descriptive content can use `512–680px` measures depending on context.

### 6.2 Grid

- Desktop partner grid: five equal cards.
- Desktop use-case grid: two equal cards, approximately `572px` each with a `20px` gap.
- Desktop eligibility grid: six cards.
- Desktop rewards grid: asymmetric, approximately `0.95fr / 1.05fr`.
- Mobile: all of these become a single column.
- At `sm` widths, selected grids become two columns.
- At `lg` widths, restore five-, six-, or asymmetric desktop layouts.

### 6.3 Breakpoints

Use a Tailwind-like system:

```text
base: < 640px
sm:   ≥ 640px
lg:   ≥ 1024px
```

### 6.4 Spacing scale

The design uses a compact `4px` base scale:

```text
4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 48px
```

Common card gaps: `12, 16, 20px`.

Unlike the iQOO design, this page does not use huge `112px` section padding. Its rhythm is tighter because the content is institutional and information-rich.

Observed desktop section padding:

- Partners: `36px 0 28px` after the hero.
- Use cases: approximately `24px 0 28px`.
- Design principles: approximately `20px 0 36px`.
- Eligibility: `40px 0`.
- Team: `24px 0`.
- Rewards: `48px 0`.

Observed mobile section padding:

- Partners: `24px 0 20px`.
- Use cases: `20px 0 24px`.
- Design principles: `16px 0 32px`.
- Eligibility: `32px 0`.
- Team: `24px 0`.
- Rewards: `40px 0`.

## 7. Shape system

### 7.1 Radii

```css
--radius-small: 10px;
--radius-icon: 11px;
--radius-medium: 14px;
--radius-card: 16px;
--radius-large-card: 20px;
--radius-feature: 22px;
--radius-hero-card: 24px;
--radius-pill: 9999px;
```

- White partner and eligibility cards: `14–16px`.
- Use-case cards: `24px`.
- Design-scope and team panels: `20–22px`.
- CTA buttons: pill-shaped.
- Prize panel: `20–24px`.
- Icon backgrounds: circular or softly rounded `10–12px` tiles.

### 7.2 Borders

- Default border: `1px solid rgb(10 22 40 / .05–.10)`.
- Outline CTA: `1.5px solid rgb(10 22 40 / .22)`.
- Inset pale-blue controls: border near `#D6E2ED`.
- Section boundaries use a single low-opacity navy rule.
- Do not use pure black borders.

### 7.3 Shadows

Default elevated card:

```css
box-shadow:
  0 1px 2px rgb(10 22 40 / .06),
  0 16px 40px -20px rgb(10 22 40 / .24);
```

Primary CTA:

```css
box-shadow: 0 8px 22px rgb(12 60 108 / .28);
```

Large feature panel may use:

```css
box-shadow:
  0 2px 4px rgb(10 22 40 / .07),
  0 32px 64px -24px rgb(10 22 40 / .30);
```

Keep shadows cool, low-opacity, and close to the surface.

## 8. Header

### Desktop

- White fixed/sticky-looking navigation bar, approximately `80px` high.
- Left cluster presents multiple partner logos as one visual identity row.
- Middle/right area uses short text links.
- Primary register CTA is pinned at the far right.
- Use subtle bottom border, not a heavy shadow.
- Partner logos use `object-fit: contain` and consistent visual height, even when source aspect ratios differ.

### Mobile

- Header height around `66px`.
- Retain the five-logo lockup in a compressed row.
- Hide desktop text navigation and register CTA.
- Show a circular hamburger control at the right.
- At `390px`, content uses approximately `20px` side margins.

## 9. Hero composition

### 9.1 Desktop

- Hero follows the header with a white background.
- Split composition: copy on the left, clinical collaboration image on the right.
- Image occupies roughly the right `60%`; audited render approximately `759 × 600px`.
- Hero image source is a wide `960 × 641` photograph.
- Use `object-fit: cover` with `object-position: 62% 40%`.
- Apply white edge gradients/fades so the image blends into the background and the split does not feel like a hard rectangle.
- Left text column begins around `51px` and is approximately `544px` wide.
- Title sequence:
  1. Gradient event name with blue year.
  2. Smaller trust-setting subtitle.
  3. Large navy audience pairing over two lines.
  4. Dark action/purpose statement.
  5. Domain line with three colored terms.
  6. Dual audience CTAs and supporting notes.
  7. Underlined role links.

### 9.2 Mobile

- Reorder the hero: image first, text second.
- The image becomes a landscape card inside the `20px` page margins.
- Remove the desktop-only full-bleed image layer rather than squeezing it.
- Event name begins below the image; measured at `31.2px`.
- Stack primary and secondary CTAs full-width.
- Supporting eligibility notes sit immediately below their respective CTAs.
- Role links remain compact and horizontally arranged where space allows.

### 9.3 Photography direction

- Prefer real doctors, researchers, patients, and technologists collaborating around a device or workflow.
- Use bright clinical interiors and natural neutral light.
- Avoid dramatic surgery imagery, isolated devices, diagnostic claims, or distress-focused patient photography.
- The subject should reinforce cooperation between clinical and technical expertise.

## 10. Components

9. **Rewards and recognition** — navy prize panel plus benefits and finale details.
10. **Closing statement** — short impact line, invitation, and CTA.
11. **Institutional footer** — logos, navigation, contacts, powered-by attribution.

## 12. Alignment rules

- Use a consistent `1220px` desktop container.
- Align hero copy, section edges, and card grids to the same left axis.
- Center only major transition headings and their overlines.
- Keep partner-card logos top-aligned and partner links bottom-aligned.
- In two-column sections, align card tops and match corner radii.
- Keep icon tiles in a consistent first column in list components.
- Preserve generous space around institutional logos; never stretch or tint them.
- In the prize section, align the left prize card height with the stacked right-side group.

## 13. Responsive behavior

### At 390px

- Document content width: about `375px` after scrollbar.
- Main inner width: `335px` with `20px` side margins.
- Desktop hero photo is hidden and replaced by an image-first mobile composition.
- Header navigation collapses to a circular hamburger.
- Gradient event name: `31.2px / 30.576px`.
- Five partner cards stack into one column with `12px` gaps.
- Scope split stacks into one column with `16px` gap.
- Use-case cards stack with `20px` gap.
- Six eligibility cards stack with `12px` gaps.
- Rewards grid stacks with `20px` gaps.
- CTAs become full-width pills.
- Footer contacts wrap across multiple rows.

### At 640px and above

- Partner and eligibility grids may become two columns.
- Use-case cards become two columns only when each has enough space for readable copy.
- Keep the hero image-first or compact split until the desktop breakpoint.

### At 1024px and above

- Restore desktop navigation and register CTA.
- Restore text-left/image-right hero.
- Use five partner columns.
- Use two use-case columns.
- Use six eligibility columns.
- Use asymmetric rewards layout.

### Overflow rules

- No intentional horizontal page overflow.
- Logo lockup must scale inside its container without clipping.
- Long medical organization names wrap naturally.
- Do not reduce body copy below `12px` just to preserve a grid.

## 14. Motion and interaction

Observed transition families:

- `150ms` for colors, border, opacity, and small transforms.
- `200ms` for shadows.
- `220ms` for card transform, border, shadow, and background using `cubic-bezier(.2,.8,.2,1)`.
- `300ms` for expanded interactive states.

Recommended motion:

- Cards lift `2–3px` on hover.
- CTA arrow moves `2–4px` to the right.
- Button shadow strengthens slightly on hover.
- Partner links shift color only; do not animate logos.
- Use-case cards may reveal more detail in a modal/drawer, with accessible focus management.
- Hamburger opens a clean sheet or dropdown; avoid full-screen dramatic transitions.
- Honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## 15. Accessibility and medical-content guardrails

- Maintain WCAG AA contrast.
- Use at least `44px` touch targets.
- Preserve semantic heading order even when the visual hero uses styled spans.
- Provide useful alt text for partner logos and the hero photograph.
- Decorative background icons use empty alt text or `aria-hidden="true"`.
- Interactive use-case cards must be real buttons or links.
- Provide keyboard focus rings in blue with sufficient contrast.
- Do not communicate clinical categories with color alone.
- Never imply diagnosis, treatment recommendations, risk scoring, or autonomous clinical advice unless the product is appropriately validated and the content is legally reviewed.
- Pair any medical scope statement with clear human oversight and source attribution.
- Cookie controls must be keyboard accessible and equally understandable.

## 16. Content style

- Lead with the collaboration model and concrete audience.
- Use plain language for healthcare workflows.
- Distinguish clearly between clinical and non-clinical scope.
- Prefer measurable language: users, institutions, timeline, eligibility, outcomes.
- Use short proof-oriented partner descriptions.
- Keep CTA wording role-specific when different audiences have different flows.
- Use exact date and location metadata near the finale card.

## 17. Copy-ready master prompt

Replace the bracketed values and give this file to the implementation assistant.

- 150ms color/opacity transitions, 200–220ms card and shadow transitions, max 300ms for expanded states.
- Card lift no more than 3px; arrow shift no more than 4px.
- Respect reduced motion.

ACCESSIBILITY AND SAFETY
- Semantic landmarks and heading hierarchy.
- WCAG AA contrast and visible focus states.
- 44px minimum controls, useful alt text, keyboard-accessible cards and menu.
- Categories use text as well as color.
- Keep health solutions assistive and human-supervised; do not introduce unsupported diagnostic or treatment claims.

CONTENT AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
[PASTE NEW COPY, AUDIENCES, PARTNERS, USE CASES, ELIGIBILITY, REWARDS, CTA DESTINATIONS, AND ASSET LIST]

Deliver a production-ready implementation. Verify the full desktop layout, an intermediate tablet width, and a 390px mobile layout. Report intentional deviations from this blueprint.

## 19. QA checklist

### Visual system

- [ ] Deep navy, hospital blue, mist, and white retain their assigned roles.
- [ ] Identity gradient appears only in the main brand/title moment.
- [ ] Sora is used for headings and Inter for body/controls.
- [ ] Negative heading tracking and compact line-height match the reference.
- [ ] Cards use 16–24px radii and cool, restrained shadows.
- [ ] Alternating white/mist sections create clear grouping.
- [ ] Institutional logos remain sharp, undistorted, and neutral.
- [ ] Hero photography emphasizes collaboration.

### Layout

- [ ] Desktop container does not exceed 1220px.
- [ ] Partner grid is five columns on desktop.
- [ ] Use cases are two columns on desktop.
- [ ] Eligibility is six columns on desktop.
- [ ] Rewards use an asymmetric desktop grid.
- [ ] Mobile inner width respects 20px margins.
- [ ] All grids become readable single-column stacks on mobile.
- [ ] No page-level horizontal overflow exists.

### Interaction

- [ ] Primary and secondary CTAs have clear hover/focus states.
- [ ] Use-case cards are keyboard operable.
- [ ] Mobile navigation is accessible and traps no focus.
- [ ] Cookie notice is accessible and does not block essential actions.
- [ ] Motion is subtle and reduced-motion safe.

### Accessibility and content

- [ ] Heading order is semantic despite custom hero styling.
- [ ] Contrast passes WCAG AA.
- [ ] Touch targets are at least 44px.
- [ ] Every meaningful image and logo has alt text.
- [ ] Domain categories are labelled in text.
- [ ] Medical scope and human oversight are explicit.
- [ ] No unsupported diagnostic or treatment claims appear.

## 20. Fidelity priorities

If implementation time is limited, preserve these in order:

1. Navy/mist/white color-role discipline.
2. Sora and Inter hierarchy.
3. Human collaboration hero composition.
4. Compact 1220px institutional grid.
5. Rounded white cards with restrained cool shadows.
6. Partner ecosystem and role-specific CTAs.
7. White/mist section alternation.
8. Domain accents, prize treatment, and small interaction details.

The design remains recognizable with entirely original content and assets when these priorities are preserved.
